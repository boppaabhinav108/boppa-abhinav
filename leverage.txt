#### Leverage (Hat Values):
Leverage values diagnose if a data point has an extreme value in terms of the independent variables. A point with high leverage has a great ability to influence the regression line. The threshold for considering a point as having high leverage is typically set at 3(k+1)/n, where k is the number of predictors and n is the sample size.
